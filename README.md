# TilemapBuilderp5js
A basic tilemap map builder for p5 js made in p5 js that exports to and itself uses Tilemapp5js

To use simply host the HTML file somewhere or paste the code into the p5 js web editor, set things like the dimensions of the canvas and tilemap and the tiles and then just click to place or erase! Use Q and E to move back and forth between the tiles and W to print to console where you can copy the array and paste it into your project! Extra instructions and details are in the style.js file.
